	title = {Comparative {Study} of {Demosaicing} {Algorithms} for {Bayer} and {Pseudo}-{Random} {Bayer} {Color} {Filter} {Arrays}},
	abstract = {The image registration by digital cameras and video cameras requires digital filters to be posed onto the photo-sensitive sensors (CCD and CMOS). The filters are arranged in patterns across the face of the image sensing array. The most commonly used color filter array is Bayer pattern. An alternative of this pattern is a Pseudo-Random Bayer color filter array (CFA). Its structure differs considerably from the regular structure of the original Bayer filter. The purpose of this research is to present a comparison and evaluation of both color filters, based on two criteria: an objective – peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and subjective (visual quality). The filters efficiency is assessed by experimental studies on a set of test images – vector and real photographic ones. The results obtained during the experiments are presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a brief survey of the algorithms for interpolating images represented in the form of the Bayer patterns is given, and a new interpolation algorithm considerably improving the image quality is suggested. The suggested algorithm is based on the Kimmel algorithm improved by introducing several modiﬁcations, such as a more accurate interpolation of the green color, adaptive control of the number of the iterations, and projection onto the input data.},

	doi = {10.1109/83.784434},
	abstract = {A simplified color image formation model is used to construct an algorithm for image reconstruction from CCD sensors samples. The proposed method involves two successive steps. The first is motivated by Cok's (1994) template matching technique, while the second step uses steerable inverse diffusion in color. Classical linear signal processing techniques tend to oversmooth the image and result in noticeable color artifacts along edges and sharp features. The question is how should the different color channels support each other to form the best possible reconstruction. Our answer is to let the edges support the color information, and the color channels support the edges, and thereby achieve better perceptual results than those that are bounded by the sampling theoretical limit.},
